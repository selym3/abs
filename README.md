# abs

python solver for absolute value expressions

designed to work mostly with nested absolute values of polynomial expressions

## note

this is an expiremental project I made to see if I could get python to do my math hw

## features

* represent standard polynomials
* find roots up to second order
* represent piecewise functions
* break standard polynomials in absolute values into piecewise functions

## todo

* parse polynomials from string
* clean code to make expressions easier to build
* make sure piecewise, polynomial, and term are polymorphic
* find roots to *some* higher order polynomials

## bugs

* second order expressions with abs not working
